## AI and Robotic Healthcare System
Description: 
This project leverages AI and robotic technology to monitor and analyze patient vitals in real time. The system predicts potential health conditions based on collected vitals and uploads the data to a cloud endpoint for further action.
Features:
- Real-time vitals collection
- AI-based predictions for health conditions
- Secure cloud data upload
- Optional visualization of patient vitals
